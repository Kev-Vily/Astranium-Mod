It has remained in the hands of the [[]blue]Sentinels[[]] for centuries. It is up to you to conquer this planet and seize its resources for yourself.\n\n-------\n\nThis is a WIP mod that adds a new planet, Aziris, with plenty of new content to explore. There isn't a campaign yet, but all mod content can be checked out in sandbox, and you can join the discord for custom maps (and more!):\n[[]purple]https://discord.gg/2qc4WaCreP [[]]\n",
